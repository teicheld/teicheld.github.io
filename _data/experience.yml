  job_title: Software Engineer
  description: |
    I am currently working at NatWest as a front end engineer focusing mostly on a corporate banking product called Bankline.
    Working as part of a scrum team consiting of 5 developers, 2 testers and a PO/BA I have the oportunity to help drive the team forwards and
    work with the PO defining what we are building.

    I spend most of my time working on a specifc area of a large application that our team take ownership over. The front end is a <mark>React</mark> app
    that talks to an API built using a collection of <mark>Java</mark> microservices. I have spent time working in multiple parts of the stack including
    helping to define our front end architecure to follow best practices to implementing PDF and CSV export in a microservice.
    
    Last year I took the lead on rebuilding the login journey to our application. I worked with the architects and designers to create something that would
    be fit for purpose and be easy to maintain for years to come. I then built this to a high standard which lead to a seamless switch over from the previous
    system with no issues. More recently I have acted as a consultant to external teams and application architects to advise on how we should be building new
    functionality within our application. I have also built reusable components to the same standards as opensource libraries which have been used by different teams across the bank.

    I enjoy learning about all areas of our application which allows me to be a go-to person for knowledge and queries within my team and the other teams
    in the office. I am always looking to suggest improvements and challenge what and how we are working to make sure we are delivering the best service
    to the customers while also developing to the highest standards.

  job_title: Developer

    During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
    also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
    workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
    of our software using <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Backbone</mark>, <mark>Marionette</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Vuex</mark>.

    For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over
    600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <mark>Symfony</mark> to provide a backend API and
    <mark>Backbone</mark> for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> to provide
    search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours
    communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.

    Towards the end of my time at Simitive my role involved assisting with the company's devOps, this included managing
    our <mark>AWS</mark> infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating sites. I also spent time configuring and maintaining
    our clients SSO, this mostly involves configuring new clients who are using <mark>AD FS</mark>, <mark>Shibboleth</mark> and
    <mark>CAS</mark> but also maintaining our software's SSO functionality.

    I was asked to update an existing Android app to the latest version of Android and to fix any issues caused by
    this as well as a few other existing issues. This project had a very tight time scale and I was able to complete
    it in very good time while providing regular updates to the client.

    While working at Nudge I was able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large
    enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations.
    At Nudge I was also given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and to gain new skills in things
    such as <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark> and <mark>Gulp</mark>. I also worked on a number of <mark>iOS</mark> and
    <mark>Android</mark> applications.

    During my time at Nudge I was able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and
    also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded
    developer.

    During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a
    great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their
    team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.

    I started working for GWS Media part time during my third year at University and continued full time once I had
    graduated. It was during this role that I learnt many of the fundamentals that I have been building on over
    the past 3 years. Whilst at GWS I had the opportunity to work with:
    <mark>Drupal</mark>, <mark>Magento</mark>, <mark>Bootstrap</mark>, <mark>Codeigniter</mark>, <mark>Android</mark> and <mark>iOS</mark>.

    I feel like having the opportunity to use a large range of different things early on in my career has given me
    the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.
