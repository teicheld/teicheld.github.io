    I decided to become a programer two years ago. Through the effort of understanding and maintaining the GNU software and the Linux system I did a deep dive into the BASH command language. After feeling comfortable automating my daily tasks, I was ready to go a step further learning to realize my idea of building a open marketplace...

          I learned php and html and built it from ground up. Everytime after implementing successful a new feature I felt great everytime.

I decided to focus on a decentraliced model to become sustainable as bitcoin and quit development on this version. But still I cant keep my hands complete away, because I like what I have built so far. I set it online for demonstration purposes. It was time to go on further with something else.

          I learnd each keyword and the syntax of the language by solving related problems until I had gone through them all. After that I was accepted at the coding college "Codam" in Amsterdam. Suprising for me was how rigorous our programs are penetrated so I begon to think about harden my code against edge cases. A new value to which I was gratefuly exposed was the value of peer reviews. Reading somebody elses code and explaining my own raises your learning curve. Since then I am community focused.
