          I learnd each keyword and the syntax of the language by solving related problems until I had gone through them all. I discovered pairprogramming to deepen my skills through those sessions I was gratefuly exposed to the value of peer reviews. Reading somebody elses code and explaining my own raised my learning curve. Suprising for me was how rigorous our programs have been penetrated through testing so I began to think about harden my code against edge cases.

          At the education program i am currently enrolled in, I can choose my path out of comprehensive resources and would appreciate a partner out of the economy to give my some orientation which choice is going to be rewarding.
